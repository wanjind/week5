# DB: Good! I had intended that you'd sum up all numbers, not just those less
#     than 10, but the directions were a bit vague.

#!/bin/bash

#select only numbers on column 3 that are <10, cut 3rd column
awk '$3>10' num.txt | cut -f 3 

#select values more than 10 on column 4, cut column 4
awk '$4<10' num.txt | cut -f 4

# DB: Good idea, but this will test the values in the columns independently. I was trying
#     to get you to think about how we might test them jointly. Also, why columns 3 and 4?
#     In the directions, I talked about a file with two columns of numbers.
